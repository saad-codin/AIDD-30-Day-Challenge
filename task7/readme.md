## SpecKit Plus:
- Speckit plus is a structured framework designed to help teams and individuals plan, design and implement software using a step by step workflow. It breaks the development process into five phases making it easier to think, document and execute ideas in an organized way 

## Constitution: 
- It is the foundation of the project. It includes standards that apply to every work you do in a project. It is written once per project and it sets the direction of rules that needs to be followed  

## Specify: 
- This focuses on defining the exact requirements. Here we identify features, user needs, acceptance criteria, constraints and the system’s functional and non functional expectations. It provides what the system should do before any coding begins  

## Plan: 
- This converts requirements into a structured development strategy. It includes system design, workflow mapping, architectural decisions and risk assessment. It tells how we will build the project and ensures preparation before starting it 

## Tasks: 
- The Tasks breaks the plan into actionable, trackable units of work. Each task describes a specific action, expected output and related resources 

## Implement: 
- In this phase the actual coding, testing, validation and integration take place. AI completes the task, verify results, fix issues and produce a working version of the software
