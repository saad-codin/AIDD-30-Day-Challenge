## ✍️ Reflection Activity (40 min)

### What does AI-Driven Development mean to you? 

AI-Driven Development isn't about replacing developers with AI its about the collaboration of developers with AI agents 
to improve productivity, efficiency and gain sustainable long term architecture that runs multiple AI agents in parallel 
creating a more seamless and immersive development experience


### How do you see the future of Human–AI Collaboration in software development? 

I consider the Human-AI Collaboration the future of software development where developers wont be writing code anymore 
but building a set of specifications that uses multiple AI agents running in parallel to execute that workflow resulting in a more productive, efficient, and sustainable software development model
